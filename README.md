# Intrusion_Detector


The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security system that serves as a layer of protection for the infrastructure. The IDS technology has advanced significantly over time to keep up with the growth of computer crime. Since the technology's inception in the middle of the 1980s, studies have been done to improve the ability to detect assaults without endangering network speed.
Python, Keras, SK Learn, Matplotlib, pandas, and deep learning neural networks have been used to develop this detector. Our dataset is made up of a dump of TCP/IP protocols as well as common, well-defined services like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, and TELNET, as well as their relevant features, from which we are developing a predictive model that can distinguish between intrusions and good connections from bad ones.
This project study also looks at four popular evasion methods to see if they can avoid the most recent IDSs. An effective IDS should be capable of properly identifying various attack types, including intrusions that use evasion strategies.
